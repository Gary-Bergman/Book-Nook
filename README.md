# Project1 - Book Nook

The history of storytelling goes back thousands of years, and is a huge part of culture as we know it. With advancements in technology, the demand for books has steadily decreased. Movies enable the enjoyment of a story in a matter of hours, with pleasant visual and audio representations. However, reading a book provides an experience you simply cannot replicate in movie form - and Book Nook's goal is to help the user achieve that.

"Book Nook" is designed to take the user's love for movies, and help them share that same experience with books. Upon visiting the site, the user will enter a movie they enjoy. In return, Book Nook will randomly generate a book based on the details of the movie entered. This way, the user may retrieve multiple books based on the same movie choice. The most recent search will be saved to local storage, so they can refer to their "library" in the future.

We utilized multiple API's in order to achieve this functionality. OMDB receives the user's movie selection and returns very useful information - including genre, plot summary and an image to display to the page. The apple Itunes API utilized the information from the user's movie selection, to match with a book of similar genre.
